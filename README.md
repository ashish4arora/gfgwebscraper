WebScraping GeeksForGeeks to make a list of dp questions in a csv/excel format which can then be used to keep a track of your progress
---
I found a wonderful and extensive list of dyanmic programming questions on a geeksforgeeks [page]("https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/") and thought it would be extremely useful to have the list as an excel sheet which could be followed easily and so that I could keep track of my progress. 
In this python program I am using requests,beautifulsoup and csv module. After obtaining the basic csv file from my programme it can be formatted on excel itself.
